Authentication: client and server communicate w/ TLS. Server admin uses plugin command to generate access tokens that correspond with a username. The user can then log in with the access token and set their password.

Authentication steps:

Admin submits a username, gets a token back. Admin gives token to user. User connects with the token, sets his password.

If user checks "remember my info", on connect the client will generate a cert w/ these fields:

County: blank
State: blank
Locality: blank
Organization Name: server hostname
OU Name: Minecraft
Common Name: their username

server checks CN = the username they're logged in as and signs it, sending back the cert. The client adds it to its keystore.

When a client connects, it sends an auth request that's either "password" or "trust". If it's "trust" the server will check the certs that were received during the SSL handshake and will send an OK if it trusts any of the certs. If it's "password" the server will check the hash of the password received and send an OK if the hashes match.
